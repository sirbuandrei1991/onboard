# Hello and Welcome!
Meteor-Tuts is one of the projects closest to our hearts designed as a useful tool for any programmer
that wants to step up his/her game. Navigating through this complex but rather easy to understand tutorial you will be 
accompanied by video tutorials for each chapter and for that access www.meteor-tuts.com. 
We recommend you to take it step by step in order to achieve a better understanding and mastery of the MeteorJS framework, so
we created for you several branches, each of them being an iteration of the tutorial
